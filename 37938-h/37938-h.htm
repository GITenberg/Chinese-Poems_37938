<h2><i>PREFACE</i></h2>

<p><i>The initiative of this little book was accidental. One day in the early
part of last summer, feeling weary of translating commercial documents,
I opened a volume of Chinese poetry that was lying on my desk and
listlessly turned over the pages. As I was doing so my eye caught sight
of the phrase, 'Red rain of peach flowers fell.' That would be
refreshing, I said to myself, on such a day as this; and then I went on
with my work again. But in the evening I returned to the book of Chinese
poetry and made a free translation of the poem in which I had seen the
metaphor quoted above. The translation seemed to me and some friends
pleasantly readable; so in leisure hours I have translated some more
poems and ballads, and these I now venture to publish in this volume,
thinking that they may interest readers in other lands, and also call
forth criticism that will be useful in preparing a larger volume which
<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>I, or some better qualified</i> <i>scholar, may publish hereafter; for it
can hardly be said that the field of Chinese poetry has been widely
explored by foreign students of the Chinese language.</i></p>

<p><i>Many of the translations in this book are nearly literal, excepting
adaptations to meet the exigencies of rhyme and rhythm; but some are
expanded to enable readers to understand what is implied, as well as
actually written, in the original; for, after all, the chief aim of the
translator of poetry should be to create around the mind of the reader
the sensory atmosphere in which the mind of the poet moved when he wrote
the poem. Whether I have attained a measure of success in such a very
difficult task must be decided by the readers of these translations.</i></p>

<p><i>It should be borne in mind by students more or less familiar with the
Chinese language that there are many versions of the stories and legends
related in these poems, and these versions, again, have been variously
interpreted by Chinese poets. A little reflection of this kind will
often save a critic from stumbling into difficulties from which it is
not easy to extricate himself.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p><p><i>A few notes are given at the end of each poem to</i> <i>explain historical
names, &amp;c., but not many other notes are required as the poems explain
themselves. Indeed, the truth of the saying, 'One touch of nature makes
the whole world kin,' has been impressed on my mind deeply by this
little excursion into the field of Chinese poetry, for the thoughts and
words of such poems as the 'Journey Back,' 'A Maiden's Reverie,' 'Only a
Fragrant Spray,' 'The Lady Lo-Fu, 'Conscripts leaving for the Frontier,'
'The River by Night in Spring,' 'Reflections on the Brevity of Life,'
'The Innkeeper's Wife,' 'A Soldier's Farewell to his Wife,' &amp;c., show us
that human nature two or three thousand years ago differed not a whit
from human nature as it is to-day.</i></p>

<h2 id="A_FEW_REMARKS_ON_THE_HISTORY_AND_CONSTRUCTION_OF_CHINESE_POETRY">A FEW REMARKS ON THE HISTORY AND CONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE POETRY</h2>

<p>The earliest Chinese poems which have been preserved and handed down to
posterity are contained in the 'Shi-King', or Book of Poetry.
Translations of this book were first made by Roman Catholic
missionaries, and later by Dr. Legge whose translation, being in
English, is better known.</p>

<p>The Shi-King contains three hundred odd poetical compositions, or odes,
as they might more correctly be described, most of them being set to
music and sung on official and public occasions.</p>

<p>But many more odes than those in the Shi-King existed at the dawn of
Chinese literature. Some native scholars think that several thousand
odes were composed by princes, chiefs, and other men of the numerous
petty States which were included in Ancient China; and that criticism
and rejection by later literary compilers, especially Confucius, reduced
the number deemed worthy of approval to 305, which make up the Shi-King.
It is, however, quite impossible to say how many odes were composed in
that early period; many more than those preserved<span class="pagenum">[11]</span> in the Shi-King
undoubtedly were made, and we can only regret that, when later scholars
began to collect and criticize these earliest poetical effusions of
their ancestors, political and other motives induced them to prune or
lop off whole branches of the nascent tree of poetry with such unsparing
hands. Fragments of a few early odes not contained in the Shi-King
remain, but such fragments are not numerous.</p>

<p>As to the value of these early odes critics differ widely. By some
Western writers they have been compared favourably with the Psalms, the
Homeric poems, &amp;c., while other writers think that they do not rise
above the most primitive simplicity. Some of the odes are undoubtedly of
considerable poetical value; and all critics must acknowledge that the
Shi-King contains a great deal of valuable information respecting the
States of Ancient China, and the people who inhabited them in the
earliest stages of their existence.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to give this brief account of the Shi-King because
it has loomed so largely in the eyes of students of Chinese literature
as to exclude from their vision the vast field of Chinese poetry in
which hundreds of famous Chinese poets have, at different periods,
wandered, and mused, and sung, for two or three thousand years, and
their wanderings are described and their musings sung in thousands of<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
poems which are unknown to foreign students of Chinese literature. They
have heard of the Shi-King, a few even have read it; but of the great
poets of China, who have in a long succession appeared and done immortal
work and passed away during nearly three thousand years, they know but
little or nothing at all. My object in publishing this little book is to
correct this false perspective, not by assailing the Shi-King, but by
bringing into view a few of the poets and a few of their poems (which
can only be very inadequately set forth in translations by a writer who
is not a poet), and thus make a beginning in an undertaking that will
be, I hope, continued and perfected by men who have more leisure and
greater poetical skill and inspiration than I possess.</p>

<p>After the compilation of the 300 odes by Confucius, there was a period
of about one hundred years during which but little attention was given
to the making of poetry. The earliest poetical compositions handed down
after those preserved in the Shi-King are the 'Li-Sao' by K&uuml;h-Yuen, of
the Tsu State, 280 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, several poems by Su-Wu and Li-ling, and
nineteen poems by unknown writers. All these were composed during the
Han Dynasty or earlier, and they are regarded as poetical compositions
of great worth by native scholars, although they do not conform to the
rules which have guided Chinese poets in writing<span class="pagenum">[13]</span> poetry since the T'ang
Dynasty. Indeed, one commentator has described their perfection as 'the
seamless robe of heaven', i.e. the dome of heaven&mdash;the sky. These early
poetical compositions are marked by greater simplicity of language,
deeper feeling, and more naturalness than the poetry of later dynasties,
which is often cramped by the highly elaborate technique introduced by
the poets of the T'ang Dynasty.</p>

<p>'The Journey Back,' 'Only a Fragrant Spray,' 'The Swallow's Song,' 'The
Innkeeper's Wife,' 'A Song of Tze-Yuh,' 'A Maiden's Reverie,' 'Su Wu's
Farewell to his Wife,' 'Reflections on the Brevity of Life,' are
specimens of this period.</p>

<p>During the later Han Dynasty, especially in the reign of Kien-An (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
196), and in the reign of Hwang-T'su (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 220) of the Wei Dynasty,
several poets of conspicuous ability arose, and their compositions
compare favourably with the three hundred odes and the ancient poems
following the odes.</p>

<p>From the Wei Dynasty to the T'sin Dynasty, and on through the 'Luh-Chao'
(Six Dynasties&mdash;the Wu, Tsing, Sung, T'si, Liang, and Chen, covering the
period from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 220 to 587), one poet after another gained an
ascendancy and each found many imitators; but the poetry of this period
is more elaborate and florid than deep and natural.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>From the Chen Dynasty (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 557-587) to the end of the Sui Dynasty (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
589-618) there was but little good poetry produced: it was, in fact, a
time of literary decadence which continued even into the beginning of
the T'ang Dynasty. Then a change took place, and great poets arose who
formed the T'ang School of Poetry, and the poetical technique of that
school has been more or less closely copied by all writers of poetry to
this day; and during the most flourishing years of the T'ang Dynasty the
production of poetry was so rich and abundant that that period is
regarded by the Chinese as the Golden Age of Poetry.</p>

<p>One native commentator has likened the development of poetry to a tree:
'The three hundred odes of the Shi-King may be regarded as the root: the
poems of Su-Wu and Li-ling as the first sprout from the root, and those
of the Kien-An period as the increasing growth of the sprout into a
stem, while the poems of the Six Dynasties are the first branches and
leaves; then in the T'ang Dynasty the branches and leaves became more
and more abundant, and flowers and fruit appeared crowning the noble
tree of perfect poetry.' He then goes on to say: 'Students of poetry
should carefully study the matter, and form, and style of the poetry of
this period, as they show the source and development, the root and the
full-grown<span class="pagenum">[15]</span> flourishing tree of poetry. The root must not be lost sight
of in the profusion of branches and leaves, that is, students must not
read the poems of the T'ang period and neglect those of ancient times;
both must be studied together in order to understand the poetry of the
later periods.'</p>

<p>Another native critic writes: 'The poets of the T'ang Dynasty developed
a style of their own in poetry different from those that preceded it.'
The leading poets of the T'ang period had ability to seize all that was
best in ancient poetry and embody it in a style of their own which is a
natural development and not a slavish imitation.</p>

<p>The most prominent among the men of genius who effected this great
change were Chen Tze-ang, Chang Kiu-ling, Li-Peh, Wei Ying-wuh, Liu
Tsong-Yuen, Tu-Fu, Han-Y&uuml;, Tsen-T'san, Wang-Wei, Wang-Han, Li-Kiao and
Chang-Shoh; and of these Li-Peh is regarded by all Chinese as a
heaven-born genius&mdash;'an Immortal banished to earth,' while Tu Fu is the
scholarly poet, deeply versed in all branches of Chinese literature,
which gives depth, and breadth, and style, and infinite variety to his
poetical compositions, which, however, though very numerous, form but a
part of his contributions to the literature of his country.</p>

<p>The glory of the T'ang poetry dimmed somewhat<span class="pagenum">[16]</span> towards the end of the
dynasty; but during the Song Dynasty (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 960-1278), which followed the
brief epoch of the Five Dynasties (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 907-960), Eo Yang Siu,
Wang-An-shih, Hwang Ting-kien, Ch'ao Pu-chi, Luh-Yu, and other poets
added fresh lustre to the glory of Chinese literature by producing many
poetical compositions which could not be omitted from a large anthology
containing all the best Chinese poems; but in this small book space for
two or three only can be found.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the great poets of the T'ang and later
dynasties did not always follow the new poetical technique of the T'ang
Dynasty. Many of their best poems are written in the ancient style; and
I have written 'ancient style' against a few of such poems among the
translations, but not against all of them.</p>

<p>An introduction to Chinese poetry, reviewing extensively its rise and
progress, the style of each period, and the characteristics of the work
of each poet, would fill a large volume&mdash;several volumes indeed would
hardly suffice for an exhaustive review of such a vast field of work.
But the very brief review contained in the preceding pages will enable
readers to see that the three hundred odes are by no means the whole of
Chinese poetry; they are, indeed, only the beginning&mdash;the source of a
great river whose<span class="pagenum">[17]</span> countless branches, some deep and pure, others
shallow and sparkling, have flowed down the ages, fertilizing and
beautifying every period of Chinese life and thought, and producing a
vast reservoir of poetry which has inspired many in every generation
with higher sentiments of nature, country, love, friendship, and
literature.</p>

<p>As this book of translations is chiefly intended for readers who do not
understand the Chinese language, no attempt has been made to insert the
Chinese characters for the names, &amp;c., printed in the Romanized form;
but, following the advice of friends who are well versed in Chinese
themselves, I hope, hereafter, to publish a small volume containing the
Chinese text of the translated poems only, with a few notes which may be
useful to beginners. To reprint the Chinese text and notes with the
English translations in one volume would add considerably to the cost of
the book, while only a comparatively small number of readers&mdash;students
of the Chinese language&mdash;would find the Chinese text and notes useful.<span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>In order to understand this arrangement of characters, it should be
borne in mind that Chinese characters are distinguished not only by the
phonetic sounds, but also by tones resembling musical notes.</p>

<p>Of these only four are generally recognized in poetical compositions:</p>

<p>(1) The Ping-sheng, or low and even note.<span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>(2) The Shang-sheng, or sharp and ascending note.</p>

<p>(3) The Kh&uuml;-sheng, or clear and far-reaching note.</p>

<p>(4) The Ruh-sheng, or straight and abruptly finished note.</p>

<p>These tones help to distinguish words which have the same phonetic sound
but different meanings. For instance, the word&mdash;</p>

<p>
'li' (Ping-sheng)  = black.<br />
'li' (Shang-sheng) = village.<br />
'li' (Kh&uuml;-sheng)   = sharp.<br />
'li' (Ruh-sheng)   = strength.<br />
</p>

<p>In written Chinese each of these words is distinguished by a different
character, and the tone is, therefore, of secondary importance; but
occasionally a character has two tones&mdash;a ping and a kh&uuml;, for instance,
and then each tone indicates a difference of meaning, or distinguishes
the use of the word as a substantive from its use as a verb.</p>

<p>But in poetry these tones are used to make rhythm as well as to express
meaning, and when used for this purpose they are divided into ping and
tseh, the ping representing the ping or low, even tone, and the tseh the
other three tones, Shang, Kh&uuml;, and Ruh. This brief explanation will
enable the reader, I think, to perceive what is regarded by Chinese as
the rhythm of a poem. In the diagrams given above, the first line
consists of two ping tones, followed by three tseh tones, which are
followed by two ping<span class="pagenum">[21]</span> tones; and the arrangement of the characters in
each line in terms of ping and tseh forms the rhythm of Chinese poetry.
When compared, it will be seen that there are lines or couplets which
are in contrast to, or harmonize with, other lines, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But it is not necessary that the tones of all the characters in each
couplet should agree, excepting the first and last lines which always
agree exactly&mdash;tone for tone. In the other lines, the tones of the
first, third, and fifth characters in a seven-character line, and the
first and third in a five-character line, may be varied&mdash;ping for tseh,
or tseh for ping; but the second, fourth, and sixth characters in
seven-character poems, and the second and fourth in five-character poems
must not be changed; when the ping tone should be used it must be used,
the tseh may not be substituted for it, and when the tseh should be used
it must be used, the ping may not be substituted for it. And when the
opening tone of the first line is a ping, the opening tone of the line
following must be tseh, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The following two poems are perfect specimens of the 'Ts&uuml;eh', or poem of
four lines, which may be regarded as the unit of Chinese poetical
composition. The first specimen shows a 'ts&uuml;eh' beginning in the Ping
tone; and the second specimen a 'ts&uuml;eh' beginning in the Tseh tone:<span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>As I have stated above the 'ts&uuml;eh' of four lines, whether the line is
composed of five or seven characters, may be regarded as the unit of
Chinese poetical composition. In order to make a 'l&uuml;h' poem four more
lines, composed exactly according to the ping-tseh arrangement of tones
in the ts&uuml;eh, are added to the ts&uuml;eh; while a 'p'ai-l&uuml;h' poem is made by
continuing this process beyond eight lines.</p>

<p>Besides the ping and tseh arrangement of tones in<span class="pagenum">[23]</span> each line to form the
metre or rhythm, the final characters of the first, second, and fourth
lines of the ts&uuml;eh may rhyme with each other; but these rhymes are also
controlled by the ping-tseh tones. For instance, in the specimen of a
perfect ts&uuml;eh given above, the final characters of the first, second,
and fourth lines are kwan, ts'an, and shan, and these sounds rhyme in
Chinese; but it will be observed that all three words belong to the ping
tone, and this is the rule generally followed in the technique of modern
poetry, that is, poetry made according to the new rules introduced by
the poets of the T'ang Dynasty; but in ancient poetry, words both in
ping and tseh tones were used for rhymes; and poets of all periods have
used both systems&mdash;ancient and modern&mdash;in their poetical compositions.
The tendency in recent dynasties, however, has been to follow the
elaborate technique of the modern school of poetry in which great skill
in the art of poetical composition is too often more highly prized than
true poetry, and consequently mere cleverness is mistaken for genius.</p>

<p>These few remarks on the use of the ping-tseh tones in the rhythm and
rhyme of Chinese poetry must not be regarded by readers as an exhaustive
summary of the system, which is much more intricate than it seems, owing
to many qualifying rules<span class="pagenum">[24]</span> and conditions as to its application in
relation to the other factors required to form a correct poetical
composition; they will, however, suffice to give a general conception of
the part played by the ping and tseh tones in the technique of Chinese
poetry, especially in modern poetical compositions. But although the
ping-tseh tones are indispensable to the rhythm of the modern poem,
there are, as I have remarked above, other factors required to form a
perfect 'ts&uuml;eh', or 'L&uuml;h', or 'pai-l&uuml;h', and most elaborate instructions
as to the use of each character or line in relation to other characters
and lines in the same stanza must be mastered before a poem can be
constructed that would satisfy the eye and ear, and literary standard,
of the modern Chinese critic of poetry. But it must not be forgotten
that the scholarly Chinese poet is just as familiar as his Western
<i>confr&egrave;re</i> with the metaphor, simile, allegory, epigram, climax, and all
other figures of speech which are common in the prose and poetry of a
literary people; and the skilful use of these in harmony with the rigid
ping-tseh rules concerning rhythm and rhyme is a task of considerable
difficulty for the conscientious poet. Fortunately the ancient poets did
not adhere very rigidly to technique; and not a few modern poets have in
many of their compositions imitated the ancient style. Besides the<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
ts&uuml;eh and l&uuml;h there are many poetical compositions, such as the ko,
hsing, yin, tz'e, k'&uuml;h, p'ien, yong, yao, t'an, ai, yuen, and pieh&mdash;many
of them of very ancient origin, which are all put under the generic term
'yoh-fu', implying that they are compositions which can be set to music
and sung, chanted, recited, &amp;c. Some of the most charming poetical
compositions are found in Chinese anthologies under the above-mentioned
headings; but in this brief introduction it is only possible just to
call the attention of readers to them without attempting to describe the
form of each separately. For the same reason I cannot attempt any
description of the ancient terms fung, ya, song, &amp;c., to which, however,
translators of the Shi-King have given some attention.</p>

<p>It is doubtful, indeed, whether the information which I can crowd into a
few introductory pages will help readers to gain an insight into Chinese
poetry in the making, or utterly confuse them; but I am loath to send
forth the translations without an introduction, and I must, therefore,
remind readers again that this introduction gives only the barest
outline of the rise and progress of Chinese poetry, and of a few of the
factors which are required by modern technique in the construction of
poetical compositions since the revival of literature and poetry in the
T'ang Dynasty.<span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>It should be observed that no attempt has been made to reproduce the
technique outlined above in the English translations of Chinese poems in
this book, as it would be impossible to restrict the translations to
lines of five and seven words. In Chinese each character is a word of
one syllable only, therefore a five-character line of poetry contains
only five monosyllabic words, and a seven-character line seven
monosyllabic words; but as many articles, pronouns, prepositions,
auxiliary verbs, &amp;c., which are understood in the Chinese, must be
inserted in the English translation in order to connect the meaning of
the five or seven monosyllabic words which form a line of Chinese
poetry, it is obvious that, in most cases, the length of the line in the
translation must be longer than that in the original Chinese. Some
Chinese poems might be rendered into English in lines of five or seven
syllables without doing much violence to the meaning of the original,
but in most cases, the five or seven monosyllabic line in Chinese is
translated into English far more correctly and accurately by a line of
eight, ten, or more syllables, because the Chinese reader mentally
inserts connecting parts of speech which must be written in English to
make the grammar correct and the meaning of a line complete.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<h2 id="BIOGRAPHICAL_NOTES_OF_A_FEW_OF_THE_MORE_EMINENT_CHINESE_POETS">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES OF A FEW OF THE MORE EMINENT CHINESE POETS</h2>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Li Peh.</span></p>

<p>Li Peh (Tai Peh; Tsing Lien) lived during the T'ang Dynasty, probably
from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 699 to 762, and he is regarded as the most brilliant of all
Chinese poets.</p>

<p>He was connected by descent in the ninth generation with the Imperial
family of the T'ang Dynasty, but was born in a remote part of the Empire
now included in the Szechwan Province.</p>

<p>When but ten years old Li Peh was familiar with poetry and other
branches of literature, and, as he grew older, his ability and genius
attracted the attention and praise of the highest in the land. When
introduced to the Court at Chang-an, Ho Chi-chang, one of the courtiers,
exclaimed:&mdash;'He is one of the immortal genii banished to earth.' For a
short time, too, he was greatly favoured by the Emperor, Hs&uuml;en-Tsung,
but, having incurred the enmity of the Emperor's chief concubine, he had
to withdraw<span class="pagenum">[28]</span> from the Court and relinquish all hopes of official
promotion.</p>

<p>He then travelled widely, writing many poems on the beauties of nature,
and also in praise of wine and music, to the former of which he was too
strongly addicted.</p>

<p>In the later part of his life, it seems, he became involved in political
intrigues, for which offence he was banished to a distant region. But in
his old age he was allowed to return, and he ended his days peacefully
at T'ang-t'u (a place near the modern Nankin), whose governor was a
kinsman named Li Yang-ping.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Chang Kiu-ling.</span></p>

<p>Chang Kiu-ling (Tze Sheo) was the son of an official in the T'ang
Dynasty. At a very early age he displayed great ability, and while still
comparatively young, took a high literary degree (Tsintze), and then
held high office under the Emperor Hs&uuml;en-Tsung, with whom he sometimes
ventured to remonstrate for his licentious life. Once when all the
courtiers presented valuable gifts to the Emperor on his birthday, Chang
Kiu-ling presented him with a book written by himself and styled 'The
Thousand Year Mirror', showing the causes of success and failure in
former dynasties. His advice, however,<span class="pagenum">[29]</span> was not seriously heeded at the
time, but after his death his faithfulness was appreciated and he was
ennobled and afterwards canonized by the Emperor.</p>

<p>It is recorded by one writer that Chang Kiu-ling, when a youth, trained
pigeons to carry letters to his friends.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Wei Ying-wuh.</span></p>

<p>Wei Ying-wuh was a native of Honan during the T'ang Dynasty, and his
poetical skill ranks very high even in that famous period. During the
Cheng-Yuen reign (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 785-804) he was appointed Prefect of Suchow,
where his beneficent rule and devotion to literature called forth the
gratitude and admiration of the people.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Su Shi.</span></p>

<p>Su Shi (Tze-Chan; Tong-Po), <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1036-1101, was a native of Mei-shan in
Szechwan. He won the highest literary degrees, and was advanced from one
official office to another until he became a Minister of State; but,
owing to political feuds and intrigues, he was degraded from his high
office in the capital and sent to fill inferior posts in distant parts
of the Empire, where he wrote poetry and diffused a love of literature
among the people he ruled.<span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Tu Fu</span> (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 712-770).</p>

<p>Tu Fu (Tu Tze-Mei) was the son of Tu Fan-yen, a high official in the
T'ang Dynasty. In the estimation of his countrymen he ranks next to Li
Peh among the great poets of the Tang Dynasty, and a few critics would
give him a still higher place.</p>

<p>When Tu Fu's literary ability and poetical genius were made known to the
Emperor, office and honours were bestowed on him.</p>

<p>In the poetical composition known as the Seven-character Pai-l&uuml;h, Tu Fu
is the most famous of all the poets of the T'ang Dynasty, if not of all
Chinese poets.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Eo Yang Siu</span> (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1017-1072).</p>

<p>Eo Yang Siu (Yong-Shuh) was a famous scholar of the Song Dynasty; and he
filled high official posts both in the capital and provinces, under the
Emperor Ren-Tsong.</p>

<p>Being a man of integrity and independence he remonstrated with his
Imperial master on several occasions, and sometimes suffered temporarily
for his courage. His character, however, was appreciated by the Emperor,
and restoration to favour followed every temporary eclipse. After his
death he was canonized as Wen Chong Kong. His literary works are
numerous.<span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Su Wu</span> (200-100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).</p>

<p>Su Wu (Tze K'ing) lived in the Han Dynasty. When sent on a mission to
the Khan of the Hsiung-nu he was seized by that ruler and ordered to
renounce his allegiance to the Han Emperor; and on refusing to do this
he was cast into prison. Afterwards he was banished for many years to
the desert region around Lake Balkash, where he was compelled to tend
the flocks of the Hsiung-nu; but he persisted in his loyalty to the Han
Dynasty. On his return to China, when a grey-headed old man, he was
greatly honoured by the Emperor, and his portrait was hung up in the
Khi-lin Koh (Council Chamber).</p>

<p>He is held up as a pattern of loyalty by Chinese writers. His poetical
compositions are ancient but not numerous.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Li Ling</span> (First Century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).</p>

<p>Li Ling was a military commander in the Han Dynasty. Given command of an
army in the war against the Hsiung-nu he rashly advanced into the
enemy's country with only a few thousand soldiers, who were surrounded
and all but three or four hundred killed, and Li Ling was captured, and<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
spent the rest of his life in exile. His name is mentioned in the

<span class="i0">Revealed Muh-Lan both bow and spear could wield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her skill and courage won her widespread fame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While the master was wrapped in slumber the fishing-boat slipped its stake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drifted, and swirled, and drifted far over the broadening lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till islets, and mainland, and forests came into view once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the fisherman gazed and pondered the lay of the new-found shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But erelong he espied an opening, shown by the broken wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in venturous mood he steered his boat into a narrow cave,<span class="pagenum">[146]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where an azure mist obscured the scenes through channels long and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the current bore him gently into a world of long ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this old, flower-bestrew&egrave;d land, at first no path the eye could tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For on the streams and on the banks the red rain of peach flowers fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet from the purple-shadowed mountains which screened this favoured land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowed forth the Peach-Fount river along its bed of silver sand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, winding with the stream, the thickset peach-tree groves with red-veined flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid the cooling waters flowing in and out the shady bowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there along the banks, set in nooks of calm repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were cottage homes of rustic work from which the wreathed blue smoke arose;<span class="pagenum">[147]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing that in this happy valley beyond the world's dull roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life went on as sweet and simple as in the golden days of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the people of this valley in their ancient garments clad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were courteous in their manners and rejoiced in all they had;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the dogs and fowls beside them harmonized with all at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mulberry-tree and flax-plant hid the former barren land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dwellers in this favoured region saw the stranger guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They set before him food and wine and kindly bade him rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when true courtesy allowed they asked of the things and men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world of sin and sorrow far beyond their quiet life's ken.<span class="pagenum">[148]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the time to leave them came, and the stranger could not stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They led him through the cavern's channels and saw him sail away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after life the fisherman often tried again, but failed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the opening to the Valley through which he once had sailed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the sand of life through the glass its course had nearly run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought he saw the way lay to it beyond the westering sun.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rent within the skirt, she mused, no pang in you has wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would the loss of my good name cause you a serious thought;<br /></span>

who was precluded from entering the presence of the Emperor Yuan (Han
Yuan Ti) by an avaricious courtier, Mao Yen-sheo, who bribed the court<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
painter to present ugly portraits of Chao-Chi&uuml;n to the Emperor, because
her family would not pay the large sums of money he demanded. Afterwards
Mao Yen-sheo's wiles became known to the Emperor, and he fled to the
Khan of the Hsiung-nu to whom he showed a true portrait of Chao-Chi&uuml;n.
Thereupon the Khan invaded China with a great army, and demanded the
Lady Chao-Chi&uuml;n as the price of peace. Afraid to refuse, the Chinese
Emperor surrendered Chao-Chi&uuml;n to the Tartar chief who then retired
beyond the Wall. According to a popular but untrustworthy version of
this story, Chao-Chi&uuml;n, when she reached the Heh-long Kiang (Amur
River), jumped into the stream rather than cross the boundary which
separated her from her native land.<span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p></div>

<span class="i0">And rush out in the evening breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent on catching the mirrored moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright in the sea as the sun at noon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tricked by the moon to their hearts' content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoreward they move on music bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pipes of Pan, and flutes, come out,<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
